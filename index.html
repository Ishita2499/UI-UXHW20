                <h5>Overview</h5>
                </br>
                <h6>About Chess'n Math</h6>
                <p>The Chess and Math Association (CMA) is a non-profit organization which promotes chess in schools in Canada at an affordable price. Chess helps children develop logical thinking, self-confidence and concentration skills in a structured and fun environment.</p>
                <h6>The Problem</h6>
                <p>We identified that, the Chess'n Math organizations website has an extremely high bounce rate, due to a myriad of reasons. Along with the competition, the following factors are the reasons for the difficulties.
                    1. Confusing Navigation & Homepage Design 
                    2. Disorganized content & links
                    3. Extremely long checkout process</p>
                <h6>The Solution</h6>
                <p>Instead of redesigning the entire website, we will first focus on improving the homepage, course finder, the checkout and registration pages.
                    We believe, that by redesigning the Chess'n Math website with a focus on creating an organized and seamless navigation, we will increase the number of registrations.</p>

                    <h5>Research Methods Used</h5>
                    <p>Before we dived into redesigning the website, we had to conduct qualitative & quantitative research.For our research, we looked at both the users and stakeholders. We conducted:</p>
                    <h6>5 User Interviews:</h6>
                    <p>15-20 Minutes each, asking for their motivations for lessons, and their experience with booking classes.</p>
                    <h6>Stakeholder Interview:</h6>
                    <p>Learning what they expected from the re-design and what they wanted for the future.</p>
                    <h6>Survey:</h6>
                    <p>Getting quantitative data about their experiences, and asking for more feedback for improvement.</p>
                    <p>In both the interview and the survey, we asked questions focused around, the users experience navigating through the website and what changes they would suggest be made to the website. As for our stakeholders, we asked what questions around what they wanted to achieve from the re-design and which existing elements of the website worked well in their opinion.</p>
                </br>
                </br>
                <h5>Interview Highlights</h5>
                <p>User research was quintessential. I learned that people used multiple resources to plan activities when traveling so that they get the best experiences during their trip, but also preferred to not have a detailed plan and go with the flow.</p>

                <p>We learned that, Chess'n Math has a credible, established clientele and has partnerships with many schools. They have information on their website that is easy to understand. However, the website's main pain points are: excessive amounts of information, a disorganized interface and lack of cohesiveness.</p>

            <p>This is just phase one of the overall rebrand journey for the Chess'n Math organization.</br></br>

                The next steps would involve making iteration to the current prototypes to further improve the overall design & flow. We will also work on adding the additional elements highlighted below and work on completing the entire web redesign.</p>
            <ol class="lists-align">
                <li>ADD A FILTER:
                    So that people can find certain
                    classes that fit their needs easier.</li>
                </br>
                <li>AUTONOMY:
                    Have the ability to break off from
                    the major website so that you know
                    you're only dealing with Toronto.</li>
                </br>
                <li>ADD MORE IMAGES:
                    Be able to add more interactive
                    images and videos for the website to
                    make it more engaging.</li>
                </br>
                <li>FINISH IT OFF:
                    Be able to build out the rest of the website pages!</li>
